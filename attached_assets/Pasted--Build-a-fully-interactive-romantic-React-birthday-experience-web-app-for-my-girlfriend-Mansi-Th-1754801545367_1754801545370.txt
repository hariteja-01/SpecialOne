🔥 Build a fully interactive, romantic React birthday experience web app for my girlfriend Mansi. This is a gift from me, Hari, for her birthday on Tuesday, August 12, 2025.

It should feel magical, flirty, emotional, modern, and very romantic — the kind of thing she’ll never forget.

This app will be deployed on Vercel, so build it as a static frontend using React (Vite preferred).

🎯 APP STRUCTURE OVERVIEW:
✅ Sections (each as a React component):
⏳ CountdownScreen

🌹 IntroScreen

💘 FlirtyQuiz

🎁 GiftBoxReveal

💌 LoveMessage

🎇 FinalScreen (Confetti + Thank You)
